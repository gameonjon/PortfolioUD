          Hey, Iâ€™m Jon, enjoy-er of video games, music, and movies. 
          I graduated from the University of California Merced with a B.S. 
          degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have worked with 
          multiple programming languages and frameworks focusing mostly on 
          web/mobile app development. I would best be described as a blank 
          canvas, ready to be painted with the companies talents and skills.

              VGDB was made to display a number of available videogames, 
              their designers and publishers, as well as reviews and videos 
              from other users. This project was created using HTML/CSS 
              for the UI, Python for the schema, MySQL for the RDBMS, 
              and Node.js/Express.js for the RESTful API. This project can
              be found in my Github repos.

            <p className='projDesc'>
              Main purpose of this project was to better understand the UX
              process and accurately communicate between different departments
              within a company. From my perspective, sharing spotify profiles
              does not accurately represent the current listening behavior a 
              user has. It mainly shows outdated playlists and no options to
              reorganize. I utilized Figma for lo-fi and hi-fi UX development,
              and recieve mentorship from and UX designer.

              Using Unity and C#, I was able to develop a 2D mobile 
              game, a simple execution of the famous mobile game of 2013, 
              Flappy Bird. I also used Gimp and FlatIcon to create my 
              scenery and sprites. The main purpose of this project was 
              to practice publishing/shipping of mobile games. Previously 
              available on Google Play.
