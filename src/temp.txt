VGDB was made using web development and 
Relational Database Management System with HTML/CSS and python, respectively.
These two resources were connected using Node.js as the REST API. The
purpose of this project was to create an interface and storage
management system to hold various videogames and their info of
publishers, designers, etc.

VGDB was made to display a number of available videogames, their 
designers and publishers, as well as reviews and videos from other 
users. This project was created using HTML/CSS for the UI, Python for 
the schema, MySQL for the RDBMS, and Node.js/Express.js for the RESTful
API.

Addressing user pain points when sharing profiles. 
From my perspective sharing with friends doesn't showcase an accurate 
representation of the current listening behavior. Main purpose was to 
better understand the UX process and accurately communicate between
cross-functional departments. Utilizing Figma for lo-fi and hi-fi UX
development, and receiving mentorship from UX Designer.

reorganize. I utilized Figma for lo-fi and hi-fi UX development,
and recieve mentorship from and UX designer.
